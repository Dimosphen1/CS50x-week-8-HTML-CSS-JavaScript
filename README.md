# CS50x-week-8-HTML-CSS-JavaScript
This homepage was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and deployed with static files to Heroku from the Django project.  

I used Google Maps JavaScript API from Google Cloud Platform to connect a map to this page; however, they are currently available "for development purposes only" because I don't want to attach my credit card:)  

Also, I highly encourage you to visit both desktop and mobile versions of this site because of the properties of the navbar.
